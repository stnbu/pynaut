Sorry. There's nothing usable here yet.

Please feel free to jump in and collaborate if you think this looks interesting.

The goal is for this to be a tool one can use to "descend" into a python object and thoroughly explore its attributes, its attributes' attributes, etc, etc. The UI stuff has not been written at all and at the moment, there are lots of loops and stuff that make recursive testing difficult. It's a revision or so away from being useful. I'd like to be able to tack this onto various existing debuggers, maybe.
